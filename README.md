Quantitative comparison of three-dimensional structures is a fundamental task in structural biology, especially in such fields as domain fold classification and structural evolution studies. The most popular measure of the first class, the global RMSD, is shown to be the least representative of the degree of structural similarity because it is dominated by the largest error. The root-mean-square distance (rmsd) calculated between equivalent atoms in two structures, defined as follows:

rmsd = sqrt(âˆ‘d**2/n)

where d is the distance between each of the n pairs of equivalent atoms in two optimally superposed structures. The rmsd is 0 for identical structures, and its value increases as the two structures become more different. Rmsd values are considered as reliable indicators of variability when applied to very similar proteins, like alternative conformations of the same protein.
